This club has now grown to much more than just coding, I have met fascinating people, made lifelong experiences, and gotten to work on incredible meaningful projects. Outside of Coding With A Purpose, I am a member of Team 303 in FRC Robotics and Model UN. In my free time I enjoy listening to music and sleeping although I donâ€™t get a lot.",
